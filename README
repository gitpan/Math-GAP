Math-GAP version 0.03
=====================

This module provides the ability to execute GAP code inside
Perl. It uses GAP interpreters wrapped inside Perl objects. 


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The default GAP interpreter is located during the first step. You should have
nothing to do if :
- you can start the GAP interpreter from command line simply typing 'gap'
  or 'sage -gap' (More precisely if it is in your $PATH).
- you have set a GAP variable to the correct value, e.g.
  with bash shell:
           >export GAP='/my/path/to/sage -gap'
  or tchsh shell:
           >setenv GAP '/my/path/to/sage -gap'

Otherwise you will be prompted the location.

Whatever, you can change this default value when creating objects.


INSTALLATION in a special dir

You can use LIB=some/path or PREFIX=some/path to change default
installation directories, e.g

   perl Makefile.PL LIB=some/path

or

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=some/path

Make sure the final module path appears in the @INC array (set PERL5LIB, use
lib, ect.) when you exec your Perl code.
See ExtUtils::MakeMaker documentation for details
